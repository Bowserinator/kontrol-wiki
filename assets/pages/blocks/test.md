# Creative Resistor


<ModInfoCard :blockData="block" :electricalData="electrical" />

## Description

This machine uses energy to extract dusts out of certain blocks and ores, making it essential to producing different kinds of tools. Not to be mistaken with the Crusher, this machine is the pulverizer equivalent in other mods.

Can also be used to turn Coal or Charcoal into Compressed Carbon, Redstone into Compressed Redstone, Diamond into Compressed Diamond and Refined Obsidian Dust into Compressed Obsidian, all for use in the Metallurgic Infuser.
Note: Compressed Carbon is worth 100 carbon; Coal is worth 10 and Charcoal is worth 20; hence it is better to refine coal and use Compressed Carbon.
